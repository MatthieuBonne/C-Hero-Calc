# Cosmos Quest PvE Instance Solver

### This fork
I'm only updating [Alya's calc](https://github.com/Alya-N/C-Hero-Calc) with new heroes and skills, please check her repository for more info.
Any help would be welcome, this calc isn't my priority ;-)

### Other tools
You'll find [CQ MacroCreator](https://github.com/MatthieuBonne/CQMacroCreator) quite handy ; also, if you like CQ but don't want to be in front of your screen day and night, [CQ Automater](https://github.com/MatthieuBonne/CQAutomater) will help you.
Public data and stats can be found on [CQ Tools](http://dcouv.fr/cq.php).
